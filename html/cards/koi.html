                <p>Carp are highly adaptable coldwater fish, ready for almost any pond. <i>Koi</i> are ornamental carp originating from breeding in early 19th century Niigata, Japan. Early koi were domesticated for consumption in China, and their hardiness allowed them to be propagated to Japan, where colored varities arose and were bred. Random mutation introduced these colors, as even today, the percentage of preferred color carp among other spawn is less than 1%. However, it has been known that koi in the colors red, blue, white, black and yellow have existed in China and Japan since at least 74 CE. Systematic breeding of koi began in Japan in the 1820s, mostly for food and usually near rice paddies, although during a flood in one area, carp would escape and begin living in ponds near shrines. From 1804 - 1830, people in these areas began breeding red and white koi along with black koi, and crossing them to create combinations, then continued breeding them to refine the colorations. At about 1875, colored koi were popularized and demand and breeders increased, creating some expensive koi, before Niigata Prefecture banned ornamental koi production. It was seen as too speculative, which was a major setback until the ban was lifted soon after due to demand. Colored koi were presented to the Crown Prince of Japan after an exposition, which also introduced colored koi to the general public. Since then, koi have spread and popularized around the world.</p>
