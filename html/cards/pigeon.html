                <p>Derived from the rock dove, first mentions of the now over 350 breeds of domestic pigeons are over 5,000 years ago in Mesopotamian cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphics. Pigeons held historical importance as food, pets, holy animals, and messengers. Nobles used to keep pigeons as a symbol of status, with more pigeons according to how wealthy you were, and entire jobs created to take care of pigeons. They were used in World War 1 to deliver messages, and had their own division in the U.S. military called the U.S. Army Signal Corps' Pigeon Service. However, between President Richard Nixon and a comedy show calling pigeons "flying rats", the general public has come to see pigeons as stupid, dirty pests. Domestic pigeons are actually quite clean and intelligent, able to "read", follow directions, deliver messages through gunfire, and even identify cancer cells. However, not all people hate pigeons. Mike Tyson, the professional boxer, has grown up with and cared for pigeons his entire life. He still continues to live with pigeons, building a coop to breed them and keep more. Domestic pigeons are easily trainable, and are quite beautiful as well. Many breeds have a white base, with patterns typically in black or golden brown, although some, like the Victoria Crowned Pigeon or Archangel pigeon, come in blue, red, and purple.</p>
