                <p>Mexican Black Kingsnakes are a stocky subspecies of kingsnake that, despite their name, are colored solid dark chocolate with a beautiful iridescent shimmer to their scales. They are a subspecies of the common kingsnake, and prefer rocky or lushly vegetated areas in the Sonoran Desert, Northwestern Sinaloa, Mexico, and small parts of Arizona. Wild kingsnakes usually reach a size around 90-120 cm or 3-4.5 ft. However, captive kingsnakes can sometimes exceed 1.5 m or 5 ft in length, likely due to having a stable and larger diet. MBKs can weigh up to 1.3 kg or 3 lbs depending on their size in adulthood, and can live 20 to 30 years. Baby MBKs can have yellow or white checkered markings running up from their bellies, but these marking have been mostly bred out in captivity. These markings will completely fade by the time they are an adult. Mexican Black Kingsnakes are, like all other kingsnakes, constrictors and non-venomous. They eat other snakes, earning them the name "kingsnake" and particularly eat rattlesnakes, which led to them developing a resilience to various kinds of venom. Mexican Black Kingsnakes also eat small rodents, lizards, birds, and eggs. Mexican Black Kingsnakes make excellent pets, and are regularly kept in captivity due to their good nature, easy care, and medium size.</p>
