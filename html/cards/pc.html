                <p>A PC would allow me to make many 3D models, websites, draw, and download whatever game I want without worrying about the storage space left for other people. The games I would like to play include Ark: Survival Evolved and Ark: Ascended, with all the maps and maybe some mods as well. Ark maps required hundreds of gigabytes of storage space, so I can't download very many on a regular computer. And despite all the ridiculous bugs that Ark has, it is also a game that I really love. I would also like to play games such as all of the Elder Scrolls games, all of the Assassin's Creed games, Aragami, Hollow Knight, Hollow Knight: Silksong, The Sims 4, all of the Monster Hunter games, and several others that take a lot of storage and graphics. 3D models take a lot of graphics, and my current computer does not handle it very well with everything else we have on it. I would like to make very detailed models as well, that take up lots of space - things like forests and mountains and rivers. Then I would be able to animate these, and create whole scenes in whatever setting I want at any time. Drawings would also take up a lot of storage, especially with how many I would make, with at least three or four each day. I would also like to make websites, either just for practice or for my friends, and downloading all of the images will take up a lot fo space.</p>
