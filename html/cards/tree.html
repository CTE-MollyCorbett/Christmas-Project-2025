                <p>Mature trees quickly add thousands in value to a property. Mature maples can add $5,000+, cedars over $10,000, and pines nearly $4,000 - without including their beauty! Trees are so valuable in the U.S. due to old arbor laws made when people grew and cut down trees on their own property to build houses, items, and for firewood. Having trees was necessary for living, unless you were rich enough to buy everything yourself, and thus the punishments for taking another person's trees became severe, and are now thousands in fines and damages. Trees are usually defined as perennial plants with elongated stems supporting branches and leaves, although there is no one definition, in botany or otherwise. The majority of tree species are hardwoods, with some softwoods. Trees evolved about 400 million years ago, after sharks, and can live to be several thousand years old. Trees evolved rings in order to provide stability as they grow taller to compete for sunlight. </p>
