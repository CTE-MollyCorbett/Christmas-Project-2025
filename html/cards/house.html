                <p>Houses are a dream for many people because the average price of a house in New York is between $400,000 to $500,000. I want to buy one that is small and rural, with a large yard. New York State is ranked 5th across the U.S.A. for housing costs. A lot of the costs are driven by high demand due to a massive population that is still growing. New York State also has some of the highest property taxes in the U.S.A., which comes from mandated school funding taxes, which, even in rural areas, are over $2,000. Also, utilities like electricity, water costs, and especially heating are high, and even higher in older homes, due to New York's long, cold winters that immediately switch to hot, humid, drought-riddled summers the other half of the year. Also, the beautiful scenery of mountains, pine and deciduous forests, rivers, lakes, and even oceans draws tourists and rich people, who rent or buy second homes. These people feed New York's economy, but they also mean that many houses are seasonal getaways or only for rent, not purchase. Also, many houses are either for sale for millions in a city, or sit on top of mountains or small communities, away from stores or any jobs. Others are in small towns, but those are small and poorly maintained, as well as having high utility costs and more necessary seasonal preparations.</p>
