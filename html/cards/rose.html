                <p>Roses are woody, perennial flowering plants, often fragrant and with thorns. There are hundreds of species and thousands of cultivars, many with large, showy flowers. Most roses are deciduous, but some, particularly those from Southeast Asia, are evergreen or nearly evergreen. Despite being known for their prickles, roses do not really have prickles for defense. Most roses have sickle shaped prickles to hold on to other plants as they climb over them, while coastal roses have densely-packed straight prickles to trap sand, reducing erosion and protecting their roots. Some roses even have vestigial prickles without points, suggesting that these prickles were once necessary but are not any longer. Roses are frequently browsed upon by deer despite their prickles. All rose species have five petals, except for two species that only have four. Roses are pollinated by insects and usually produce a red fruit called a hip, although some roses produce dark purple to black hips. Rose hips are very high in vitamin C, among the most produced by any plant. These hips are eaten by birds like thrushes and waxwings, and the seeds are dispersed in their poop. Domestic roses usually have petals too tight to pollinate and produce hips, and propagate by cuttings.</p>
