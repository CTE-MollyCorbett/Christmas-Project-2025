                <p>Greenhouses are large buildings made to regulate environments for the growth of plants. They can be heated hothouses, traditional glasshouses, or modern greenhouses. Hothouses simply refer to greenhouses that have artificial heating as well as being heated by light. Glasshouses are traditional greenhouses that were made before polycarbonate came along, which is what most modern greenhouses are made of. Glasshouses existed as early as 15th century Korea in the Joseon Dynasty, and prototype greenhouses were used to grow cucumbers for Roman Emperor Tiberius around 30 CE. In my greenhouse, I would like to have plants like large ferns, large pots of diiferent flowering mosses, calla lilies, lilies, lotuses, spicy peppers, tomatoes, rose starts, saplings, and delicate flowers like orchids and chrysanthemums that wouldn't survive all year round. I would keep various teas and herbs there as well, particularly mint, chamomile, sage, and jasmine, so that I can make tea with them. For trees, I would keep saplings until they are old enough to be planted outside and survive, and grow trees like cold-hardy oranges, apples, willows, pines, oaks, firs, and whatever fruit trees will survive the winter. I want to turn the fruits into jams to eat in the winter, and be able to walk in the shade of the trees in the summer.</p>
