                <p>I have many books already, and many more that I would like to buy. For the sake of keeping them safe and organized, a small, personal library to store them would be best. Libraries are typically collections of books, but they can have things like CDs, DVDs, audiobooks, vinyls, and any other means of recording information. In my library, I would keep things like old video game cards, vinyl records from my favorite artists, DVDs of my favorite movies, CDs of my favorite artists again, all alongside my books. For my books, I would keep entire series, with my favorites being Tokyo Ghoul, Wings of Fire, The Girl From the Other Side: Siúil, a Rún, the Black Sun series, the entire Pokemon series, the entire Naruto series but none of the sequels, all of Tolkien's books, the Dragon Daughter series, every Warrior Cats book, and Erin Hunters other books as well. I will also have more books, with single books like Call of the Wild, White Fang, some one-book dragon stories like Dragon Rider, and simply whatever other books I liked. I will also include newspaper if they have something interesting or funny in them, like maybe the comics from the newspapers. I will have a collection of all the original Calvin &amp; Hobbes comics and the original Garfield comics. I will hang paintings that either I made and liked, or ones that I bought.</p>
